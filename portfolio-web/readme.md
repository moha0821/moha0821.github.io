this is my web portfolio for my photography. I have decided to use bootsrap 4 for this assignment. 
The pictures that I have used are from a stock image website called unsplash. 
the most challenging part for this project was the portfolio section. I have used bootstrap so it was easier to put my images in a collumn and rows. 
With this assignmnet, I have learned so much more about bootstrap 4. Such as, jumbotron. 
I have used lato font from google fonts website in this portfolio.
